Greetings!

My name is Benjamin Schrooten and I have been a developer for over 20 years now!
I love Java and AWS but pretty much anything that is computer programming related I find enjoyment in. 
In this repo I plan to store my notes and other projects that I can reference. 
If I make a project public and you benefit from it thats great! If you want to improve it EVEN BETTER!
